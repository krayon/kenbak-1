# Kenbak-1

## Background

2024-08-01

The _Kenbak-1_ is considered by many to be the
[world's first personal computer][1].
I recently put together the
[PiDP-11][2] kit from
_Obsolescence Guaranteed_ and had a ball playing with it. When I read about hte
Kenbak-1, I thought it'd be great to have a replica of that too.

I quickly found Mark Wilson's AVR Atmel Atmega328 powered emulation
[Kenbakuino][3]. Despite me despising Arduino (over plain old C), this project
is complete and seems to work well so I decided to go with it.

## The plan

- Replicate the case to a reasonable degree
- Design a PCB based off Mark Wilson's work (he uses Protoboards)
- Build
- Enjoy
